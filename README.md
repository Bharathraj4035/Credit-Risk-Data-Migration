Credit Risk Data Simulation Script

This data simulation script generates two CSV files: 'Legacy credit risk data' and 'Target data warehouse'. These files contain simulated data that can be used to practice credit risk analysis, a common task performed by data analysts in companies like Deloitte. By using this script, you can generate realistic data to test and improve your credit risk analysis skills.

Purpose
The script is designed to help data analysts and professionals practice credit risk analysis by providing synthetic datasets that mimic real-world scenarios. It simulates the migration of credit risk data from a legacy system to a modern data warehouse, incorporating common data quality issues such as NULL values and incorrect calculations.
Usage

Run the script to generate the CSV files.
Use the generated data to perform tasks such as data profiling, reconciliation, validation, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Analyze the data to identify and resolve discrepancies, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards like Basel III and CRR.

Benefits

Provides a hands-on way to practice credit risk analysis.
Helps in understanding data migration challenges and solutions.
Enhances skills in data validation and regulatory compliance.
